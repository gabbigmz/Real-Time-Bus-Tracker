# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
The Map will show buses running back and forth in real time, between MIT and Harvard.
The green buses travel from Harvard to MIT and when returning from MIT to Harvard, the color will change to orange.

## How To Run
Download the files or make a copy by forking the repository to your GitHub account. 
Open the JS file to add your own API access key from Google Maps. You will also need an access key from the MBTA busses website, that you can obtain here: https://api-v3.mbta.com/  
Save it and open the HTML file in your browser. Now you can see the busses location in real time! 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
To add a list of the bus coordinates at the top of the page.
